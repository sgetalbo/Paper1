abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of the socio-economic and dwelling factors contributing to high electrical energy demand in UK domestic buildings. The socio-economic, dwelling and electricity consumption data were collected during a large-scale, city-wide survey, carried out in Leicester, UK, in 2009-2010. Annual electrical energy demand was estimated for 315 dwellings and an odds ratio analysis used to identify the socio-economic and dwelling factors that led to high electricity consumption. The effects of a number of socio-economic and dwelling factors which have not previously been studied for the UK domestic sector are included. Thus, for the first time, presence of teenagers, having electric space heating as the primary form of heating, portable electric heating and electric water heating were identified as significant drivers of high electricity demand in UK homes. The employment status and education level of the Household Representative Person, the number of floors in a dwelling, presence of fixed electric heating, and the proportion of low-energy lighting were shown to have no effect on high electricity consumption in UK homes. Given the impetus to reduce electricity consumption and CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions from the domestic sector, these observations can help shape energy saving campaigns and future energy policy.},

abstract = {Behavior of the household members and home characteristics are the major determinants of residential energy use. This study is focussed on energy-related behavioral patterns. It is based on self-reported behaviors of 145 households in Vlaardingen, The Netherlands. Energy-related behavior may not be a separate type of behavior but a contingency for other types of household behaviors, such as recreation, child care, and household chores. Two important aspects of energy contingency are home temperature and ventilation. Based on these two components, we distinguish five clusters of behavior or behavioral patterns:conservers, spenders, cool, warm, and average. The energy use of these clusters differs considerably. Consercers use less energy, while spenders use more energy than theaverage group. The coot and the warm cluster use less energy than the average group. For energy policy, the differences between these behavioral patterns (clusters) are relevant, whereas each cluster is different on sociodemographic and attitudinal variables. This requires different strategies for changing and maintaining energy-related behaviors. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency obligations (or white certificates) are increasingly used to reduce carbon emissions. While the energy efficiency obligations were originally intended as carbon reduction and not fuel poverty policies, due to recognition of the potential for regressive outcomes they often include provisions for vulnerable and low-income customers. Intuitively, reducing carbon emissions and alleviating fuel poverty seem to be two sides of the same coin. There are, however, considerable tensions between the two when addressed through energy efficiency obligations, particularly arising from the potentially regressive impacts of rising energy prices resulting from such obligations, but also the complexity of targeting fuel poor households and the implications for deliverability. Despite those tensions, the UK government decided to use energy efficiency obligations, the supplier obligation, as the main policy for reducing fuel poverty. In light of the proposals, this paper provides an analysis of the main tensions between carbon reduction and fuel poverty alleviation within energy efficiency obligations, outlines the fuel poverty provisions of the British Supplier Obligation, assesses its rules for identifying the fuel poor, and provides a critical analysis of the planned policy changes. Based on this analysis, alternative approaches to targeting fuel poverty within future supplier obligations are proposed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

More specifically, the study examined whether the explanation of household energy use and intentions to reduce it could be informed by variables from the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1985) and by variables from the value-belief-norm theory (VBN; Stern, et al., 1999), alongside socio-demographic variables. Household energy use appeared to be most strongly related to socio-demographic variables (income, household size, age), while attitudinal variables and self-transcendence values (tradition/security and power/achievement) were important too. Intention to reduce household energy use was positively related to perceived behavioral control and attitudes toward energy conservation.

abstract = {Energy consumption in the residential sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. However, much of the current debate regarding energy efficiency in the housing market focuses on the physical and technical determinants of energy consumption, neglecting the role of the economic behavior of resident households. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the use of gas and electricity is determined by the technical specifications of the dwelling as compared to the demographic characteristics of the residents. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 300,000 Dutch homes and their occupants. The results indicate that residential gas consumption is determined principally by structural dwelling characteristics, such as the vintage, building type, and characteristics of the dwelling, while electricity consumption varies more directly with household composition, in particular income and family composition. Combining these results with projections on future economic and demographic trends, we find that, even absent price increases for residential energy, the aging of the population and their increasing wealth will roughly offset improvements in the energy efficiency of the building stock resulting from policy interventions and natural revitalization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The UK Government's Department for Energy and Climate Change has been investigating the feasibility of developing a national energy efficiency data framework covering both domestic and non-domestic buildings. Working closely with the Energy Saving Trust and energy suppliers, the aim is to develop a data framework to monitor changes in energy efficiency, develop and evaluate programmes and improve information available to consumers. Key applications of the framework are to understand trends in built stock energy use, identify drivers and evaluate the success of different policies. For energy suppliers, it could identify what energy uses are growing, in which sectors and why. This would help with market segmentation and the design of products. For building professionals, it could supplement energy audits and modelling of end-use consumption with real data and support the generation of accurate and comprehensive benchmarks. This paper critically examines the results of the first phase of work to construct a national energy efficiency data-framework for the domestic sector focusing on two specific issues: (a) drivers of domestic energy consumption in terms of the physical nature of the dwellings and socio-economic characteristics of occupants and (b) the impact of energy efficiency measures on energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a method to examine structural and behavioral determinants of residential electricity consumption, by developing separate models for daily maximum (peak) and minimum (idle) consumption. We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It starts from the premise that all forms of energy and fuel poverty - in developed and developing countries alike - are underpinned by a common condition: the inability to attain a socially and materially necessitated level of domestic energy services. We consider the functionings provided by energy demand in the residential domain in order to advance two claims: first, that domestic energy deprivation in its different guises and forms is fundamentally tied to the ineffective operation of the socio-technical pathways that allow for the fulfilment of household energy needs, and as such is best analyzed by understanding the constitution of different energy services (heating, lighting, etc.) in the home. Second, we emphasize the ability of vulnerability thinking to encapsulate the driving forces of domestic energy deprivation via a comprehensive analytical matrix. The paper identifies the main components and implications of energy service and vulnerability approaches as they relate to domestic energy deprivation across the world.},

In this paper, we explore patterns of UK household energy use and associated carbon emissions at national level and also at high levels of socio-economic and geographical disaggregation. In particular, we examine specific neighbourhoods with contrasting levels of deprivation, and typical 'types' (segments) of UK households based on socio-economic characteristics. Results support the hypothesis that different segments have widely differing patterns of consumption. We show that household energy use and associated carbon emissions are both strongly, but not solely, related to income levels. Other factors, such as the type of dwelling, tenure, household composition and rural/urban location are also extremely important. The methodology described in this paper can be used in various ways to inform policy-making. For example, results can help in targeting energy efficiency measures; trends from time series results will form a useful basis for scenario building; and the methodology may be used to model expected outcomes of possible policy options, such as personal carbon trading or a progressive tax regime on household energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although physical health effects on adults appear to be modest, caregivers and children perceive significant impacts on children's respiratory health. There also appear to be significant effects on the physical health of infants, particularly on weight gain and susceptibility to illness. Mental health effects on adults emerge as significant in most studies, as do mental health impacts on adolescents. Mental health effects on children have, as yet, never been systematically assessed. Whilst several studies are methodologically rigorous, with some also based on very large samples, methodological problems remain. In future evaluations of health impacts, clinical outcomes could be more comprehensively augmented with measures that extend beyond physical health. These include measures reflecting quality of life, changes in patterns of social engagement and daily routine, and their concomitant impacts on mental wellbeing, Such measures may provide more rounded insights into the potential health impacts of tackling fuel poverty and-equally as important for policy and practice-the processes by which these impacts become manifest. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Multicollinearity is an issue in analysing electricity consumption data. Appliance ownership and use are most important in understanding electricity consumption. Dwelling and household size are likewise significant predictors. Reported attitudes hardly play a role. a b s t r a c t This paper tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors, socio-demographics, appli-ance ownership and use, attitudes and self-reported behaviours) explain annualized electricity consump-tion in residential buildings with gas-fuelled space and water heating. It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the study recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue. Using data from a sample of 845 English households collected in 2011/12, a comparison of four separate regression models showed that a model with the predictors of appliance ownership and use, including lighting, explained the largest share, 34{\%}, of variability in electricity consumption. Socio-demographic variables on their own explained about 21{\%} of the variability in electricity consumption with household size the most important predictor. Building variables only played a small role, presumably because heating energy consumption is not included, with only building size being a significant predictor. Self-reported energy-related behaviour, opinions about climate change and 'green lifestyle' were negligible. A combined model, encompassing all predictors, explained only 39{\%} of all variability (adjusted R 2 = 34{\%}), i.e. adding little above an appliance and lighting model only. Appliance variables together with household size and dwelling size were consistently significant predictors of energy consumption. The study highlights that when attempting to explain English household non-heating electricity con-sumption that variables directly influenced by people in the household have the strongest predictive power when taken together.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Throughout the industrialised world, fuel poverty is the most commonly accepted term with which to describe a household's inability to afford basic standards of heat, power and light. Whilst the term gained widespread acceptance with the publication of the UK's Fuel Poverty Strategy in 2001, little is known about the origins of the term itself. This paper traces the earliest formulations of the concept, focusing particularly on the 10{\%} needs to spend threshold which was adopted in 1991 and remains in place some 20 years later. This paper argues that understanding more about the origins of this threshold yields a more critical understanding of why fuel poverty targets in the UK have not been reached, and enables a more informed approach to setting realistic targets for the future. It also provides an opportunity to explore regional disparities in UK fuel poverty prevalence, highlighting the extent to which rigid adherence to a 10{\%} threshold has created an unstable regional mosaic of over-estimation and under-estimation.

abstract = {This paper tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors, socio-demographics, attitudes and self-reported behaviours) explain annualized energy consumption in residential buildings, and goes on to show which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the problem of multicollinearity between predictors is recognised, and addressed using Lasso regression to perform variable selection. Using data from a sample of 924 English households collected in 2011/12, four individual regression models showed that building variables on their own explained about 39{\%} of the variability in energy consumption, socio-demographic variables 24{\%}, heating behaviour 14{\%} and attitudes {\&} other behaviours only 5{\%}. However, a combined model encompassing all predictors explained only 44{\%} of all variability, indicating a significant extent of multicollinearity between predictors. Once corrected for multicollinearity, building variables predominantly remained as significant predictors of energy consumption, in particular the dwelling's size and type. Of the sociodemographic predictors, only the household size remained significant, and of the heating behaviours only the length of heating season was significant. Reported beliefs about climate change were also a significant predictor. The findings indicate that whilst people use energy, it is physical building characteristics that largely determine how much is used. This finding, together with the relatively greater time-invariant nature of building characteristics underlines their importance when focusing on seeking to understand residential energy consumption at a stock level. Retrofitting and behaviour change initiatives remain important avenues to reduce consumption, as suggested through the lower energy consumption associated with full double-glazing and shorter heating season. However, the dominance of building size also indicates that living in appropriately sized buildings is of great importance for energy consumption. The results also indicate that more than half of the variability in energy consumption cannot be explained, even when using a wide range of predictors. The paper also discusses the need to collect better occupant-related variables to give a correct representation of the impact of behaviour, such as heating demand temperatures. Furthermore, choices about dwelling characteristics could also be seen as a type of behaviour, even though it cannot be modelled in a cross-sectional analysis as used in this study.},

It discusses the determination of income and fuel costs and the possibilities for a relative and common European measure. It examines problems inherent in assessing fuel costs as a percentage of income and puts forward the arguments for a 'budget standard' approach. The paper illustrates how the size of the problem depends on the definition and chosen threshold and suggests advantages for a rating scale. It illustrates how the income composition and thresholds also govern the distribution of the target populations and the relative importance of the main causal factors, and examines the consequent policy implications. It explores the definition of vulnerable households and the importance of severity and questions whether the UK fuel poverty strategy is targeted at households least able to afford their fuel costs (as the name implies) or primarily those at risk from excess winter and summer mortality and morbidity. Finally, after examining the role of supplementary indicators, it looks at the opportunities for changing the definition and comments on the Government review of the definition and targets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The patterns of electricity consumption were studied for 27 representative dwellings in Northern Ireland. The type of dwelling, its location, ownership and size, household appliances, attributes of the occupants including number of occupants, income, age and occupancy patterns have differing but significant impacts on electricity consumption. A clear correlation was found between average annual electricity consumption and floor area. The monthly consumption of detached houses is between 3.57 and 5.17 kWh m-2; semi-detached between 3.44 and 4.59 kWh m-2and terraced houses between 2.5 and 3.9 kWh m-2. The average winter consumption exceeded the average summer consumption by 1.59 kWh m-2for detached, by 1.16 kWh m-2for semi-detached and by 1.78 kWh m-2for terraced houses. The difference in the annual demand on the grid between detached and terraced houses is between 24 and 30{\%}. The electricity consumption per person decreases as the number of occupants increases. This is particularly significant in large dwellings but smaller numbers of occupants. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bringing attention to fuel poverty as a distinct manifestation of social inequality has asserted the place of affordable warmth in the profile of contemporary rights and entitlements. As such, fuel poverty can be understood as an expression of injustice, involving the compromised ability to access energy services and thereby to secure a healthful living environment. In this paper, we consider how fuel poverty may be aligned to various alternative concepts of social and environmental justice. Whilst recognising that fuel poverty is fundamentally a complex problem of distributive injustice, we argue that other understandings of injustice are also implicated and play important roles in producing and sustaining inequalities in access to affordable warmth. Addressing fuel poverty has to involve seeking justice in terms of the cultural and political recognition of vulnerable and marginalised social groups and pursuing procedural justice through opening up involvement and influence in decision-making processes. We make this argument both in theoretical terms, and through considering the experience of fuel poverty advocacy and policy development in the UK. Opportunities for future action may be illuminated through such interconnected justice framings as wider awareness of energy, climate and poverty issues emerge. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Domestic sector energy use is increasing in the UK and currently accounts for 30{\%} of total use. Policies of liberalised energy markets have allowed greater consumer choice but have not sought to reduce carbon emissions. Overall sales of energy efficiency products are rising, but UK housing stock standards are poor and do not facilitate improved efficiency and further, the sales of such products are influenced by their price, thus the higher capital costs of products such as boilers and solar systems make them initially unattractive to consumers. Previous market-based research into the adoption of energy efficiency products has often focused on single factors, for example demographics. This has limited the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions that address a broader range of factors, such as individuals' cognitive abilities, values and attitudes, as well as external factors such as social networks, marketing, and products and services. This paper provides a wider critique of the theoretical base related to consumer behaviour, product attributes and socio-environmental theories that relate to energy use. The aim of the paper is to draw together theories relevant to energy use in order to aid policy making in the broader context and to develop the discussion around integrated theories of consumer behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It then examines the "Warm Front" program in England, which over the course of 2000-2013 saw 2.3 million "fuel poor" British homes receive energy efficiency upgrades to save them money and improve their overall health. Warm Front not only lessened the prevalence of fuel poverty; it cut greenhouse gas emissions, produced an average extra annual income of {\pounds}1894.79 per participating household, and reported exceptional customer satisfaction with more than 90 percent of its customers praising the scheme. This study details the history, benefits, and challenges of the program, and it teases out six noteworthy lessons for energy analysts, planners, and policymakers.},

abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive review of theory and research on$\backslash$nthe individual-level predictors of household energy usage. Drawing on$\backslash$nliterature from across the social sciences, we examine two broad$\backslash$ncategories of variables that have been identified as potentially$\backslash$nimportant for explaining variability in energy consumption and$\backslash$nconservation: socio-demographic factors (e. g., income, employment$\backslash$nstatus, dwelling type/size, home ownership, household size, stage of$\backslash$nfamily life cycle) and psychological factors (e. g., beliefs and$\backslash$nattitudes, motives and intentions, perceived behavioral control,$\backslash$ncost-benefit appraisals, personal and social norms). Despite an$\backslash$nexpanding literature, we find that empirical evidence of the impact of$\backslash$nthese variables has been far from consistent and conclusive to date.$\backslash$nSuch inconsistency poses challenges for drawing generalizable$\backslash$nconclusions, and underscores the complexity of consumer behavior in this$\backslash$ndomain. In this article, we propose that a multitude of factors-whether$\backslash$ndirectly, indirectly, or in interaction-influence how householders$\backslash$nconsume and conserve energy.

Logit regression analyses on a large micro-dataset reveal how household characteristics can help explain the ownership of energy using appliances. Using OLS regression models, we explore the factors affecting residential energy demand conditional on appliance ownership. Results suggest that the methods of space and water heating employed by a household are even more important than electrical appliances in explaining domestic energy usage. However, the stock of appliances must be included in such models so that results will not be biased. The methods employed in this paper can be easily adopted for studies of household energy use in other countries where household expenditure survey data are available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Clusters of higher and lower energy consumers were discovered and these were related to indicators of energy consumption. Simple and multiple regression were used to determine the strength of the relationships and identify the most statistically-significant indicators of differences in gas and electricity consumption. Although significant effects of the built-form type were not observable in the data available, the effects of related measurable and countable aspects of form, such as floor-area and numbers of rooms, were seen. Significant relationships were found with the number of bedrooms and regular home working, which may reflect changes in UK households that are expected to drive future energy-consumption.

Using survey data this paper presents an updated overview of the prevalence of European fuel poverty in the context of the accession of numerous former social states, and rising fuel prices. Analysis reveals the phenomenon of fuel poverty is occurring across the EU, with particularly high levels of fuel poverty found in Eastern and Southern European states. It is argued that there are both EU and national policy frameworks in place that address climate change and these could be used as a starting point for countries to address fuel poverty through improved domestic energy efficiency measures.

abstract = {One hundred and twenty households in Bath, U.K., had their energy consumption monitored over a 9-month period and compared (weather-corrected) to the previous year's consumption. Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period. Recommendations are made both for energy conservation policy and future research. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Data gathered from energy audits, phone surveys and smart meter readings are used to derive regression models of the electricity consumption of housing units in Oshawa (Ontario, Canada). The database used comprises 59 predictors, for 62 observations. To address the problem of multi-collinearities among the predictors and at the same time reduce the number of needed predictors, a methodology is developed based on the latent root regression technique of Hawkins [5]. Contrary to other variable selection techniques such as the stepwise method, the technique used in this paper allows an easy identification of alternative subsets. Using this technique, a reduction of 85{\%} in the number of predictors is obtained, leaving only nine of them in the final subset. These nine variables are the number of occupants, the house status (owned or rented), the number of weeks of vacation per year, the type of fuel used in the pool heater, the type of fuel used in the heating system, the type of fuel used in the domestic hot water heater, the existence or not of an air conditioning system, the type of air conditioning system, and the number of air changes per hour at 50 Pa. A regression with these nine predictors leads to an R2of 0.79, with an adjusted R2of 0.75 and all regression coefficients statistically significant at the 95{\%} confidence level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Projections of energy demand over the coming decades are critically im- portant to understanding and anticipating future resource requirements and environmental impacts such as acid rain, local air pollution, and cli- mate change (e.g., Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Household consumption of energy for space heating and cooling, lighting, appliances, transportation, and other energy services is a key driver of national energy demand. A number of demographic factors such as population size, age structure, and levels of urbanization have potentially important direct and indirect influ- ences on household demand. For example, aging may have direct conse- quences since energy consumption tends to change over the lifespan (Yamasaki and Tominaga 1997); aging could also have indirect impacts through an associated decline in household size and consequently a loss of economies of scale in energy use at the household level. However, the treat- ment of population-related variables in energy projections has been essen- tially limited to considerations of changes in population size alone (ONeill, MacKellar, and Lutz 2001; Gaffin 1998), even though significant changes in other factors, especially age structure, are anticipated in all regions of the world.},

Despite considerable research examining the plight of those affected, there has been very little empirical work examining the relationship between fuel poverty and thermal comfort and the extent of indoor cold strain resulting from inadequately heated housing. Furthermore, the effects of fuel poverty on household occupancy have not been addressed formerly. This paper employs a new national household survey of Ireland—a country with a level of fuel poverty similar to Britain—to examine these key issues. Both self-reported and objective measures of thermal comfort are utilised, and the study pays particular attention to the age profile of those affected by thermal discomfort. The results show, inter alia, that two-thirds of fuel-poor householders demonstrate cold strain, and over half of elderly households endure inadequate ambient household temperatures during winter.},

One group of scholars has argued that values, personal norms, social pressure, and information campaigns can activate and maintain individual pro-environmental behaviors. 1 This line of research has focused on interventions to activate personal norms and increase the visibility of household environmental behaviors. 2 Other researchers are more pessimistic and contend that cognitive, motivational, and social forces sharply limit behavioral change, at least for certain subtypes of environmental behaviors that involve large numbers of players and minimal personal payoffs. 3 They advocate greater use of financial incentives and structural changes that increase the convenience of environmentally-friendly behaviors. 4 Both camps of legal scholarship have neglected the less intellectually enticing, but in some cases more potent, domain of technology. Indeed, for many environmental behaviors, the scholarly debate may soon be moot. Technology and automation are poised to reduce both the need for and the costs of individual behavior modification in many contexts, including residential energy usage. Psychology research has long established that consumer adoption of energy-efficient and pollution- reducing technology has much greater impact on consumption behavior than psychological and informational interventions. 5 The comparative neglect of technology in the environmental law scholarship is worrisome: lawyers, policymakers, and scholars will need to be technology's legal architects and to balance environmental gains against autonomy, property rights, and privacy.

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Widening inequality in the distribution of resources, higher rates of unemployment and deteriorating conditions in the inner cities have concentrated attention in Britain, and elsewhere in Europe, upon the idea and exact meaning of ‘deprivation'. This scientific concept is used extensively not only in the analysis of social conditions but also, in an applied form, as an instrument of policy in allocating resources to particular regions, areas and services. This paper argues that the indicators which are chosen to represent the phenomenon are often unduly restricted and even involve double counting. As a result the distribution and severity of deprivation seems to be seriously misperceived and resources misallocated. A review of the available studies shows how the concept might be treated more coherently in relation to that of poverty.},

In addition to the traditional regression analysis, decision tree and neural networks are considered. Model selection is based on the square root of average squared error. In an empirical application to an electricity energy consumption study, the decision tree and neural network models appear to be viable alternatives to the stepwise regression model in understanding energy consumption patterns and predicting energy consumption levels. With the emergence of the data mining approach for predictive modeling, different types of models can be built in a unified platform: to implement various modeling techniques, assess the performance of different models and select the most appropriate model for future prediction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Recent quantitative and qualitative evidence documents a dramatic reduction in average direct UK household energy consumption in the last decade. The 'fuel poverty gap' in the UK (average shortfall that fuel poor households experience in affording their energy bills) has also grown substantially in that period. Here we draw on the literature on vulnerability and on recent qualitative interviews with fuel poor households to characterise the experience of energy vulnerability in the UK. Using our qualitative data, we explore energy vulnerability from the point of view of our interviewees. In doing so we identify six challenges to energy vulnerability for the fuel poor: quality of dwelling fabric, energy costs and supply issues, stability of household income, tenancy relations, social relations within the household and outside, and ill health. In analysing these challenges we find that the energy vulnerable have limited agency to reduce their own vulnerability. Further, current UK policy relating to fuel poverty does not take full account of these challenges. Any attempt to address energy vulnerability coherently in the future must engage with structural forces (policies, markets, and recognition) in order to increase household agency for change.},

Therefore, the results of these studies provide little insight into variables that could be helpful in reducing household environmental impact. In this article, an environmentally significant measure of household consumer behavior (i.e., combined direct and indirect energy use) is presented and compared with a common social science measure of proenvironmental behavior (based on popular notions of environmentally significant behavior). Two large-scale field studies were conducted among representative samples of Dutch households. The results showed respondents who indicate they behave more proenvironmentally do not necessarily use less energy. Also, proenvironmental behavior is more strongly related to attitudinal variables, whereas household energy use is primarily related to variables such as income and household size.

abstract = {The rapidly growing world energy use has already raised concerns over supply difficulties, exhaustion of energy resources and heavy environmental impacts (ozone layer depletion, global warming, climate change, etc.). The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20{\%} and 40{\%} in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50{\%} of building consumption and 20{\%} of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of offices is analysed in deeper detail. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Data were collected via questionnaires completed by 323 dwellings in Winter 2008, in the Netherlands. Three regression models were built using direct (number of lighting and appliances, duration of use) and indirect determinants (presence, dwelling-household-economic-system (DHES) characteristics); one based on the duration of appliance use and presence, one on the number of appliances and DHES characteristics, and one on the total duration of appliance use and DHES characteristics. In the first model, total duration of appliance use explained 37{\%}, presence in rooms 14{\%}, and combined model 37{\%} of variance in electricity consumption. Study/hobby rooms emerged important in this model, whereas living room and kitchen did not. In the second model, number of appliances explained 21{\%} of the variance in electricity consumption alone and 42{\%} combined with dwelling/household characteristics. Household size, dwelling type, use of dryer, washing cycles, and number of showers appeared as significant determinants, of which the last revealing a comfort related dimension of electricity use. The third model of total duration of appliance use and dwelling/household characteristics explained 58{\%} of the variance in electricity consumption. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the empirical analysis, household energy-conserving choices models are employed, using a discrete and a latent trait variable respectively as a dependent variable. The results show that socio-economic variables such as consumers' income and family size are suitable to explain differences towards energy conservation preferences. In addition, the results suggest that electricity expenditures and age of the respondent are negatively associated with the number of energy-conserving actions that a consumer is willing to adopt. Finally, other variables such as environmental information feedback and consciousness of energy problems are characteristics of the energy-saver consumer. By evaluating consumer's decision-making process with regards to energy conservation measures, we are able to formulate and propose an effective energy conservation framework for Greece. An energy policy framework is among the main prerequisites not only to achieve sustainable development but also to maintain consumers' quality of life. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The most common patterns are increasing or decreasing trend, cycle, seasonality, and irregular fluctuations (Bowerman, O'Connell, and Koehler 2005). To model a time series event as a function of its past values, analysts identify the pattern with the assumption that the pattern will persist in the future. Applying the Box-Jenkins methodology, this paper emphasizes how to identify an appropriate time series model by matching behaviors of the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to the theoretical autocorrelation functions. In addition to model identification, the paper examines the significance of the parameter estimates, checks the diagnostics, and validates the forecasts.},

Using measured electricity use data from 103 homes in Austin, TX, this analysis sought to (1) determine the shape of seasonally-resolved residential demand profiles, (2) determine the optimal number of normalized representative residential electricity use profiles within each season, and (3) draw correlations to the different profiles based on survey data from the occupants of the 103 homes. Within each season, homes with similar hourly electricity use patterns were clustered into groups using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then probit regression was performed to determine if homeowner survey responses could serve as predictors for the clustering results. This analysis found that Austin homes fall into one of two seasonal groups with some homes using more expensive electricity (from a wholesale electricity market perspective) than others. Regression results indicate that variables such as if someone works from home, hours of television watched per week, and education levels have significant correlations with average profile shape, but might vary across seasons. The results herein also indicate that policies such as time-of-use or real-time electricity structures might be more likely to affect lower income households during some high electricity use parts of the year.},
